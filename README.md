## How to add   

Like most projects on GitHub, i want to build an online community that will craft this story with me. Every entry will be read and the better the writing, or the better the ideas, the more access you will get to the repo. it is called a trust membrane, and by working on that i will give more and more people access to work on the lore. 

## What i need at the moment
